        It starts innocently enough: a parent, late at night, one tab open to a practice-test score report, another to a spreadsheet titled "Realistic Schools." In the kitchen, the refrigerator hums. In the mind, a different sound: arithmetic, anxious and relentless. What score do you need? What GPA is safe? If we can name the number, maybe we can name the future.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        If you have a child aiming for medical school, you have probably encountered the culture of metrics. People trade MCAT scores the way other families trade travel itineraries, with equal parts pride and dread. The question is understandable. The path to becoming a doctor is long, expensive, and emotionally demanding. Parents want to protect their children from heartbreak, and students want a target they can aim at without guessing.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        The trouble is that medical school admissions does not behave like a clean scoreboard. The MCAT and GPA are real, consequential signals. But "what score do I need?" is often a proxy for a different question: "Is my child going to be okay?" That is the question worth answering with the care it deserves.
      </p>

      <p class="text-center text-2xl text-gray-400 my-10">• • •</p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        To talk about "requirements," it helps to start with what the MCAT actually is. The exam is scored on a scale from 472 to 528, built from four sections, each scored 118 to 132, and the AAMC publishes score scales and percentile ranks so students can see how a number compares nationally.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Those numbers have drifted upward in recent years, a kind of slow inflation. In January 2025, the AAMC reported that the mean MCAT score for matriculants rose from 511.8 in the 2024 entering class to 512.1 for the 2025 entering class, while the median undergraduate GPA for matriculants ticked up to 3.88. These changes are small, but families feel them acutely, because admissions already feels like a narrow hallway.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        It's tempting to treat national averages as a cliff edge: below this, disaster; above this, safety. But averages are not thresholds. They are the center of a distribution, and students on either side still become doctors. What the averages can do is calibrate expectations. If a student is consistently scoring around 500 on practice tests, the conversation is not "you can't do this." It's "we should be honest about how far the current score is from the typical matriculant, and what kind of time, preparation, and support would be required to close the gap."
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        The other number families obsess over, GPA, is both simpler and messier. Simpler because it's familiar. Messier because GPAs are not standardized. A 3.7 at one university can reflect a different set of demands than a 3.7 at another; a science GPA can tell a different story than an overall GPA. One reason the MCAT exists at all is to give admissions committees a common yardstick across thousands of colleges and grading cultures.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-10">
        Yet even the MCAT, for all its standardization, is not a pure measure of intellect. It rewards stamina, strategy, and months of deliberate practice, and it can reflect access to time and resources. Admissions offices talk more explicitly about holistic review now, but the system still asks students to translate their potential into numbers.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">What Does "Good Enough" Actually Mean?</h2>

      <p class="mb-6">
        In many premed circles, 512 has become shorthand for "competitive." It's not a magic number, but it sits close to the national mean for matriculants, and it tends to open a wide range of doors when paired with a strong GPA and a coherent story of service and clinical exposure. A 517-plus score is undeniably strong, and it can help at highly selective schools. But here is the part families often miss: metrics alone still do not guarantee admission.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        The AAMC publishes an "MCAT and GPA grid" showing acceptance rates across score combinations. In the highest bracket, students with a total GPA of 3.80 to 4.00 and an MCAT of 518 to 528 were accepted at a rate just over 80 percent in aggregated national data. Those are extraordinary numbers. And still, roughly one in six applicants in that bracket were not accepted.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        That gap is not a fluke; it's the lived reality of a process that uses numbers as a filter, not a promise.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Why would an applicant with a near-perfect academic record and a top-tier MCAT be turned away? Sometimes it's volume. Some schools receive ten thousand applications for a couple hundred seats. Sometimes it's fit: public schools often have explicit missions to train physicians for their state, their rural communities, or underserved regions. Sometimes it's experience: a student can be brilliant on paper and still look thin in clinical exposure, research, service, or leadership. Sometimes it's writing and interviewing: a personal statement that never answers the question of "why medicine," or an interview that leaves a committee uneasy, can outweigh stunning metrics.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-10">
        Admissions is vague, and the vagueness can be maddening. Families want a contract: do X, receive Y. But many admissions committees read more like editors than accountants. In a guide for admissions officers, the AAMC emphasizes using MCAT data as one part of a broader evaluation, not a stand-alone decision. The exam helps committees compare academic readiness, but it cannot capture motivation, maturity, or the ability to function well with real patients and real teams.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Medical Schools Don't All Play the Same Game</h2>

      <p class="mb-6">
        There is another reason the "required score" question can mislead families: medical schools do not all play the same game.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        A quick way to see this is to look at how heavily schools lean on state residency. In the AAMC's school-by-school data for the 2023-2024 cycle, some public schools enrolled classes that were essentially all in-state. Mercer University School of Medicine reported a matriculant class that was 100 percent in-state, and the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University was listed at 99.6 percent in-state. Meanwhile, a private school like Emory enrolled a class that was majority out-of-state.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        What this means in practice is that the "score you need" may differ depending on where a student is a legal resident, and whether their state has one medical school or several. The AAMC notes in its guidance on building a school list that some schools, particularly public ones, may not accept out-of-state applicants at all or may strongly prefer residents. That preference can function like an invisible multiplier. An in-state applicant may be evaluated within a different comparison set than an out-of-state applicant who is competing for far fewer seats.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Nationally, geography still matters. In the AAMC's key findings for the 2023-2024 academic year, about 60 percent of new MD students matriculated in their home state, with a median closer to 69 percent. In other words: even in a country that loves mobility, medicine still has a hometown accent.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Parents sometimes hear this and feel a jolt of panic. Does our state help us, or hurt us? The answer is that the residency story is real, but it is not a hack. Schools can usually tell when someone is trying to borrow a zip code. What tends to matter more is alignment that can be explained without contortion: the student grew up in the region, has family there, wants to practice there, has volunteered there, understands the community's needs.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-10">
        If you are looking for a way to use this information without turning your child's life into a chess problem, think of residency as part of the realism conversation. It's one reason a thoughtful school list can save students from the emotional whiplash of applying to programs that were never going to take them seriously in the first place.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The PREview Exam: A New Layer</h2>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Just as families have gotten used to MCAT and GPA as the twin gatekeepers, admissions has quietly added another layer: assessments of professional behavior and judgment.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        The AAMC's PREview exam is designed to measure professional readiness using scenario-based questions. It is not a science test. It asks, in effect, how an applicant thinks about teamwork, ethics, accountability, and communication. A growing number of medical schools participate in PREview, and some require it. The AAMC maintains a list of participating institutions, and the University of Utah's School of Medicine is among the programs that have required PREview for certain applicant groups.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-10">
        To parents, PREview can feel like admissions expanding into every corner. Another test. Another deadline. Another way to do it wrong. But it also reflects something important: medical schools are trying, however imperfectly, to assess traits that are not captured by academics alone. They are looking for future physicians who can function in teams, navigate conflict, and make good decisions when the script runs out.
      </p>

      <p class="text-center text-2xl text-gray-400 my-10">• • •</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Retake Question</h2>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Then there is the question that tends to arrive right after the first MCAT score report: should they retake?
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        The AAMC allows retakes, but with limits: up to three times in a single testing year, four times across two consecutive years, and seven times over a lifetime. Many students retake, and admissions committees are familiar with the pattern.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        How are multiple attempts viewed? The most honest answer is: with context. A meaningful score increase can demonstrate resilience and improved mastery. A series of small increases, or a drop, can raise questions about readiness or strategy. What matters is not just the numbers, but the story behind them: did the student change how they studied, address gaps, adjust timing, get help? Or did they simply hope for a different outcome on a different day?
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        In families, the retake decision often becomes a referendum on grit. Parents worry that pushing will break their child. Students worry that not retaking will close doors forever. The decision can be wise, but it works best when it is made with a realistic plan and timeline, and with the quiet understanding that the goal is not perfection. It is alignment: a score range that matches the student's school list, plus enough bandwidth left to build the rest of the application.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-10">
        There is also a quieter truth that admissions officers rarely say out loud: some schools likely have "soft floors," minimum expectations they do not frame as formal cutoffs. Publicly, most programs emphasize holistic review and avoid hard thresholds. But in a system flooded with applications, committees still need ways to triage.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        This is where good information becomes a form of emotional safety. The AAMC's Medical School Admission Requirements database, known as MSAR, is the most comprehensive place to find school-specific data on MCAT and GPA ranges and applicant policies, though it requires a subscription. Many schools also publish their own class profiles online. Advising organizations sometimes compile those public class profile pages into tables, which can be a quick way to compare programs, as long as families confirm the numbers against a primary source for any school they care about.
      </p>

      <p class="text-center text-2xl text-gray-400 my-10">• • •</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">A Less Corrosive Way Forward</h2>

      <p class="mb-6">
        If this sounds like a lot, that's because it is. Medical school admissions asks teenagers and young adults to behave like project managers while also becoming people worth admitting. It asks families to tolerate uncertainty for years. It is, genuinely, difficult.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        But there is a way to live inside it that is less corrosive. It starts with seeing the numbers as necessary but insufficient. MCAT and GPA can help a student get read. They can widen the list of schools where an application will be considered seriously. They cannot do the work of turning a student into a future physician. That work is slower, more human, and harder to quantify.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Parents have more influence here than you might think, not by taking control, but by setting the emotional temperature of the house. When the family story becomes "we are only as good as the last score," students learn to treat themselves like volatile assets. When the story becomes "we're gathering information and making choices," students learn to treat the process like what it is: complicated, imperfect, and survivable.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-10">
        Numbers matter, but they are not the child. They are a snapshot, not a prophecy. And the goal, in the end, is not to win an admissions game. The goal is to help your child build a life in which they can care for other people without losing themselves. That is bigger than any test day.
      </p>
