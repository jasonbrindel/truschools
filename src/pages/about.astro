        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          TruSchools was founded with a simple belief: every family deserves access to comprehensive,
          unbiased information about their education options. Whether you're looking for a preschool
          for your toddler, researching high schools for your teenager, or exploring college options,
          we're here to help you navigate the complex landscape of American education.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-0">
          We believe that informed parents make better decisions. That's why we've built the most
          comprehensive school database in the country, covering over 130,000 K-12 schools and
          7,000+ colleges and universities.

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-0">
              Unlike other school directories that show only a handful of data points, TruSchools
              provides in-depth information for every school. We pull data from authoritative sources
              including the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), College Scorecard, IPEDS,
              and the U.S. Census Bureau to give you a complete picture.

              We cover the full spectrum of education options: public schools, private schools,
              charter schools, magnet schools, preschools, vocational schools, and colleges.
              Whatever type of school you're looking for, we have the data you need.

              Schools don't exist in isolation. That's why we include demographic and economic data
              for the communities surrounding each school, helping you understand the full context
              of where your child would learn.
